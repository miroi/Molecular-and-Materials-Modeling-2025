Graphite: experimental cif file retrieved from https://www.ccdc.cam.ac.uk/structures/Search?Ccdcid=193439&DatabaseToSearch=ICSD (neutron diffraction study, https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1149/2.0951410jes)

Pseudo potential: 
scalar-relativistic optimised norm-conserving Vanderbilt pseudo potential files can be downloaded from (https://www.pseudo-dojo.org/), and are also suppiled. 

DOS Plotting scripts provided:
ase_qe_np_tdos.py and ase_qe_np_pdos.py - for plotting TDOS and PDOS, works only for non-spin-polarized and non-SOC case. They expect the files to be organized in a certain order and local sumpdos.x must be supplied if needed.  

For converting crystal structures to QE format, various online/ offline tools can be used.
1) https://qeinputgenerator.materialscloud.io/ 
2) https://seekpath.materialscloud.io/ 
3) VESTA
4) ASE

Quantum ESPRESSO basics

The input file for PWscf is structured in a number of NAMELISTS and
INPUT CARDS.
&NAMELIST1 ... /
&NAMELIST2 ... /
&NAMELIST3 ... /
INPUT_CARD1
....
....
INPUT_CARD2
....
....

NAMELISTS are read in a specific order
NAMELISTS that are not required are ignored
Logically independent INPUT_CARDS can be given in any order

There are three mandatory NAMELISTS
	&CONTROL input variables that control the flux of the calculation and the amount of I/O on disk and on the screen.
	&SYSTEM input variables that specify the system under study.
	&ELECTRONS input variables that control the algorithms used to reach the self-consistent solution of KS equations for the electrons.
We will also need:
	&IONS needed when ATOMS MOVE! IGNORED otherwise !
	&CELL needed when CELL MOVES! IGNORED otherwise !

There are three mandatory INPUT_CARDS
	ATOMIC_SPECIES name, mass and pseudopotential used for each atomic species present in the system
	ATOMIC_POSITIONS type and coordinates of each atom in the unit cell
	K_POINTS coordinates and weights of the k-points used for BZ integration
We will also need:
	CELL_PARAMETERS

Details about input parameters can be found here:

https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_PROJWFC.html
https://www.quantum-espresso.org/Doc/INPUT_BANDS.html

For running jobs, the pesudopotential file must be in the job directory (or you have to specify the path).

The Atomic Simulation Environment (ASE) is a powerful Python toolkit designed for atomistic simulations, offering capabilities for setup, execution, analysis, and visualization. Its key advantages include:

	(1) Streamlining complex, multistep computational workflows
	(2) Enabling hybrid calculations by combining outputs from different codes (e.g., using Quantum ESPRESSO for DFT energies/forces while incorporating DFT-D4 for van der Waals corrections)
	(3) Supporting interoperability with numerous electronic structure codes and force fields

The framework provides researchers with a unified interface for diverse simulation tasks while maintaining flexibility in method combinations.
