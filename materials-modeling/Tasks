TASK 1: Calculate Total Energy (QE)

Step 1.1: Run the SCF Calculation
/path/to/qe/bin/pw.x < Si.in > Si.out
(if using a parallel version, invoke it by mpirun -np N /path/to/qe/bin/pw.x < Si.in > Si.out)

Step 1.2: Check Convergence
Verify if the calculation converged successfully:
grep "JOB DONE." Si.out       
grep "convergence has been achieved" Si.out  

Step 1.3: Extract Total Energy
To get the final total energy (in Ry):
grep ! Si.out
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 2: Automated Cutoff and K-points Convergence Test (ASE)

In convergence testing, we systematically increase two key parameters separately (not simultaneously): (1) Plane-wave cutoff energy (ecutwfc) (2) K-points grid density (K_POINTS). The goal is to find the point where the total energy stabilizes (saturates) with respect to further changes in these parameters. It can be done manually by running multiple SCF calculations (as in TASK 1) and comparing energies at each step. However the current task uses a ASE python script (convergence_test_si.py) to automate the process. All necessary parameters are already pre-configured in the script, including: (1) QE SCF input parameters (2) Atomic structure of silicon (3) Convergence test logic. Only one modification is required: Replace the QE executable path with your local pw.x location in the script.

The convergence script uses three parameters to automate testing:
(1) ecutwfc_values = np.arange(20, 120, 5)  # Tests cutoffs from 20 to 120 Ry in steps of 5 Ry. Determines the range of plane-wave cutoff energies to test.
(2) kpoints_values = [(k,k,k) for k in range(2, 25)]  # Tests k-grids from (2×2×2) to (25×25×25). Purpose: Defines the k-point meshes to evaluate.
(3) energy_tol = 0.01 # Sets the convergence threshold (0.01 meV/atom). The script stops when energy changes between steps are smaller than this tolerance.

Adjust ranges (e.g., np.arange(20, 80, 10)), and higher tolerance (e.g. 0.05) for quicker testing.

Step 2.1: Run the ASE job
python3 convergence_test_si.py > convergence_test_si.out

Note: When performing a series of calculations, ASE automatically overwrites the Quantum ESPRESSO output (.pwo) and input (.pwi) files after each step. How many different SCF calculations did ASE run to converge cutoff energy / K-points grid in this task?

TASK 2.2: Run a final QE SCF calculation with your converged ecutwfc and kpoints (similar to TASK 1), along with tstress = .true. and tprnfor = .true. in the input file (under &CONTROL) to compute stress and atomic forces and inspect the output.
/path/to/qebin/pw.x < Si_force_stress.in > Si_force_stress.out
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 3: Cell relaxation (QE and ASE)

In this task, we will relax the silicon experimental unit cell to determine its ground state structure, allowing both lattice parameters and atomic positions to adjust freely. Given that we're starting from a well-defined experimental structure, only minor changes are expected during the relaxation process. We will perform this using two distinct methods: direct relaxation through QE and by ASE using QE as calculator.

Step 3.1: Direct QE
/path/to/qe/bin/qe-7.4.1/bin/pw.x < cell_relaxation_si.in > cell_relaxation_si.out

Step 3.2: ASE
ASE: python3 cell_relaxation_si.py > cell_relaxation_si.out (Replace the QE executable path with your local pw.x location in the script)

When using QE directly, the calculation type must be set to 'vc-relax', requiring both the &IONS and &CELL NAMELISTs in the input file. QE's relaxation convergence is controlled by thresholds like etot_conv_thr and forc_conv_thr in the &CONTROL NAMELIST, which default to specific values if not specified (in this example we did not, so check the pw.x manual what those values are and if they are same or different for both jobs). In direct QE relxations, the final co-ordinates are after "Begin final coordinates" line in the output. 
ASE, on the other hand, employs QE as a calculator to perform a series of SCF calculations, using the calculated energies and forces to optimize the structure through its own BFGS implementation. While both methods utilize the BFGS algorithm, slight differences may appear in the final structures due to variations in their implementations (such as minimizing max force vs norm) and different threshold values. After completing both relaxations, carefully compare the resulting forces, pressure, energy, lattice parameters, and atomic coordinates in both jobs. For a well-relaxed structure, the stress should remain within ±50 kbar and forces should be negligible, how are your results?

Reminder: When performing a series of calculations, ASE automatically overwrites the Quantum ESPRESSO output (.pwo) and input (.pwi) files after each step.
Note: ASE automatically saves the complete relaxation history in the trajectory file (relaxation.traj). You can visualize the step-by-step structural evolution using ASE's GUI by loading this trajectory file. To view it, simply run: ase gui relaxation.traj 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 4: Electronic properties: A (ASE)
In this task, we'll calculate a few key electronic properties — (1) 3D charge density (using post-processing tool pp.x), (2) Löwdin partial charges (using projwfc.x), (3) total DOS (using dos.x), and (4) projected DOS (using projwfc.x) — through a streamlined ASE workflow combining SCF and NSCF calculations. The SCF calculation generates the charge density and Löwdin charges, while a subsequent NSCF calculation (with calculation='nscf' in the CONTROL namelist and matching outdir/prefix to read the SCF charge density) produces the DOS data using a denser k-grid. Each post-processing tool requires its specific input format (detailed in accompanying notes), but ASE automates the execution sequence.
   
First, copy your relaxed atomic structure into the provided ASE script (electronic_a_si.py) and update the Quantum ESPRESSO executable path to your local pw.x location.

Step 4.1: 
python3 electronic_properties_a_si.py > electronic_properties_a_si.out

Inspect electronic_a_si.out to verify all steps have completed successfully. Also inspect the individual pp, dos and projwfc input and output files. 
Open the generated charge_density.cube file in VESTA to visualize the 3D electron density. For the total density of states (TDOS), plot the first two columns (E (eV) and dos(E)) from total_dos.dat using any plotting tool (e.g., Grace, matplotlib), then shift the x-axis by subtracting the Fermi energy (found in the QE output, grep Fermi *.pwo) to align the Fermi energy to 0 eV (in Grace: Data > Transformation > Evaluate Expression: x=x-<Fermi Energy>). Repeat this process for the projected DOS (PDOS) by plotting the first two columns from the first Si atom's s and p orbital files, again offsetting by Fermi energy. Finally, examine lowdin.out and check the computed Löwdin partial charges for each Si atom. 
Compare your computed DOS with silicon's experimental band gap- does your match? Why? Why not?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TASK 5: Electronic properties: B (ASE)

n this task, we'll  automate band structure calculation using ASE. We will start with the relaxed structure from final_relaxed_structure.vasp (Task 3, ASE)and use seekpath (either online, (https://seekpath.materialscloud.io/ or installed) to generate a high-symmetry k-point path through the Brillouin zone, symmetrizing the structure. Visualize the path and note the high-symmetry labels and scaled coordinates, the copy the symmetrized cell (under Quantum ESPRESSO pw.x input) into the ASE script electronic_properties_b_si.py. Finally copy the seekpath generated list of k-point path into a file, and convert it to ASE format using:
awk '{printf("    [%s, %s, %s, %s],\n", $1, $2, $3, $4)}' kp > kp_parsed  
The workflow consists of an SCF calculation, followed by an NSCF (bands) calculation (set via calculation = 'bands' in &CONTROL, matching outdir/prefix to read the SCF charge density); then post-processing with bands.x and plotband.x. While ASE automates the execution sequence, each post-processing tool requires specific inputs similar to DOS calculations. plotband.x is optional (since bands.dat.gnu can be plotted directly (e.g., with Grace)), but it automatically marks the high-symmetry points and Fermi level in the final image.

Step 5.1: 
python3 electronic_properties_b_si.py > electronic_properties_b_si.out

Inspect electronic_b_si.out to verify all steps have completed successfully., then analyze the individual bands and review the plotband input/output files. Finally, compare your computed band structure with silicon’s experimental results.

Note: NSCF (bands) calculation does not print Fermi level, so Fermi level has to be taken from the preceding SCF step. In the job script, ASE automatically handles it.
